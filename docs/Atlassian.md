### Tools for teams, from startup to enterprise. Atlassian provides the tools to help every team unleash their full potential.

#### Get Started (tl;dr version)

- Do not access, impact, destroy or otherwise negatively impact Atlassian customers, or customer data in anyway.
- Ensure that you use your *@bugcrowdninja.com* email address.
- Bounties are awarded differently per product (see below for more details on payouts).
- Ensure you understand the targets, scopes, exclusions, and rules in Scope & Rewards.

### Focus Areas

Due to the collaborative nature of Atlassian products, we are not interested in vulnerabilities surrounding enumeration and information gathering (being able to work effectively as a team is the purpose of our products). Instead, we're more interested in traditional web application vulnerabilities, as well as other vulnerabilities that can have a direct impact to our products. Below is a list of some of the vulnerability classes that we are seeking reports for:

- Cross Instance Data Leakage/Access\*\*
- Server-side Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Stored/Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- XML External Entity Attacks (XXE)
- Access Control Vulnerabilities (Insecure Direct Object Reference issues, etc)
- Path/Directory Traversal Issues

*Ensure you review the out of scope and exclusions list for further details.*

\*\* Cross Instance Data Leakage/Access refers to unauthorized data access between instances.

	### Accepted Vulnerabilities
	In addition to traditional web application vulnerabilities, we are also interested in:
	#### Search and 3P data ingestion
	- Broken connector authentication, leakage of client secrets or tokens during the authorization process, insufficient validation of refresh tokens or token expiration.
	- Data poisoning via injection of malicious, corrupted or malformed data into the ingested 3P content that leads to system crashes or behavior anomalies or compromise the integrity of the search index.
	- Mismanagement of CORS policies leading to unauthorized cross-origin data fetching.
	- Scope overreach while ingesting or persistence of access after 3P connector is deactivated or disconnected.
	- If rate limits announced - exploitation of improperly enforced rate limits and quota on data ingestion, overloading connectors by exploiting insufficient throttling or queue management
	- Improper error handling that leaks sensitive information
	- Abusing legitimate connector functionalities to exfiltrate or manipulate data.
	- Improper enforcement of source-of-truth permissions after the data was ingested:
		- seeing document titles, snippets, or summaries of restricted documents
			- any kinds of authorization failures, examples: permissions being out-of-sync, permissions drifts between source-of-truth systems and Atlassian
	#### AI Agents and Chat
	- Incorrect information disclosure across projects, products, or workspaces due to improper filtering or misconfigured access controls.
	- Cross product AI features inadvertently suggest or display restricted content bypassing access controls.
	- Cross product AI features leak restricted content to LLM(s), sensitive data inadvertently displayed in AI-generated summaries or other features.
	- Bypass or improper authorization policies enforcement in Agents and Rovo chat, including partial data exposure.
	- Exploiting Forge integration security weaknesses
	- If rate limits announced - exploitation of improperly enforced rate limits and quota
	- Sensitive Information disclosure (PII) via AI features
	### Out of Scope or Non-eligible Issues
	- Vulnerabilities related to GraphQL, cyclic hydration & large payload processing
	- Things not explicitly mentioned in [Acceptable Use Policy | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy)
	- Trivial jailbreak prompt injections, in terms of consequence
	- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
	- Vulnerabilities exposed through multi-turn attacks
	- All kinds of insecure output handling and sensitive information disclosure not mentioned explicitly above
	### The following will be awarded points only:
	- Abuse/Misuse/Ethical bypassing [Acceptable Use Policy | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy) (AUP) enforcement mechanism
		- Exploiting explicitly outlined categories in AUP
			- Flooding or overloading AUP enforcement mechanism

	Atlassian Forge is an app development platform designed to revolutionize how Atlassian cloud products are customized, extended, and integrated.
	More information on the platform can be found here: [https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/)
	Due to the collaborative nature of Atlassian products, we are not interested in vulnerabilities surrounding enumeration and information gathering (being able to work effectively as a team is the purpose of our products). Instead, we're more interested in vulnerabilities that can have a direct impact to the Forge Platform. Below is a list of some of the vulnerability classes that we are seeking reports for:
	- Forge Platform
	- Execution environment
	- Sandbox escapes
	- Supporting GraphQL endpoints
	- Access Control Vulnerabilities (Insecure Direct Object Reference issues, etc)
	- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
	- Forge CLI - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@forge/cli
	- Deployments
	- Forge App Installation/Uninstallation flows

### Rules, Exclusions, and Scopes

Any domain/property of Atlassian not listed in the targets section is strictly out of scope (for more information please see the out of scope and exclusions sections below). **For cloud instances, researchers should use the "bugbounty-test-<bugcrowd-name>.atlassian.net" namespace** provided in the instructions below. Please do not create additional instances outside of this namespace for testing.

All resources within your instance is in scope (see below for exclusions), this includes the all of the REST APIs and any \*.atlassian.com or \*.atl-paas.net service that can be exploited from an in scope product.

## Out-of-Scope

Anything not declared as a target or in scope above should be considered out of scope for the purposes of this bug bounty. However to help avoid grey areas, below are examples of what is considered out of scope.

- Identifying apps which are installed, as long as the user level has access to the instance, is known as part of the Atlassian Connect threat model, and is an accepted risk. Please do not report this.
- Enumeration or information disclosure of non-sensitive information (e.g. issue keys, project keys, commit hashes).
- Blind XSS must not return any user data that you do not have access to (e.g. Screen shots, cookies that aren't owned by you, etc); when testing for blind XSS, please use the least invasive test possible (e.g. calling 1x1 image or nonexistent page on your webserver, etc).
- XSSs on Data Center instances that require administrator privileges will be scored as `P5 Informational` and awarded points only, as they don't let the attacker compromise Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability any more than they already could as an administrator.
- When testing, please exercise caution if injecting on any form that may be publicly visible - such as forums, etc. Before injection, please make sure your payload can be removed from the site. If it cannot be easily removed, please check with support@bugcrowd before performing the testing.
- No pivoting or post exploitation attacks (i.e. using a vulnerability to find another vulnerability) are allowed on this program. DO NOT under any circumstance leverage a finding to identify further issues.
- Customer cloud and data center/server instances and customer data are explicitly out of scope. Customer cloud instances may be in the form of \*.atlassian.net or \*.jira.com. Please only test your own "bugbounty-test-<bugcrowd-name>.atlassian.net" cloud instance or locally instantiated data center/server instance.
- Any repository that you are not an owner of - do not impact Atlassian customers in any way.
- Any Atlassian billing system. However, specific endpoints that are used inside of a target are in scope. For example, if a REST endpoint is proven to be called from one of the targets, then that endpoint is considered to be in scope. However, all other endpoints are not considered to be in scope, as they are not called from the instance at any stage.
- Only the latest version of a Data Center product is eligible for a reward. All vulnerabilities/exploits must be proven to work in the latest version of the Atlassian Data Center product.
- Any internal, development, staging, or testing services with no clear security impact to any production data or infrastructure.
- Third party add-ons/integrations others than those listed in the targets from the marketplace are strictly excluded (vulnerabilities that exist within third-party apps in any way) - we will pass on any vulnerabilities found, however, they will not be eligible for a bounty.
- Vulnerabilities that have been fixed by the vendor within the last 7 days (i.e. we will not accept reports that we are vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-XXXX within 7 days of the patch by the vendor to give our internal teams a chance to detect and patch the issue)
- Denial of Service (DoS) reports on cloud products are specifically out of scope. **Do not perform DoS attacks on any cloud instance.**
- DoS reports on Data Center products related to lack of rate limiting, request flooding, resource exhaustion, or other similar network layer/volume based attacks are not accepted.

## The following finding types are specifically excluded from the bounty (no payout)

- The use of automated scanners is strictly prohibited (we have these tools too - don't even think about using them)
- Descriptive error messages (e.g. stack traces, application or server errors).
- Fingerprinting / banner disclosure on common/public services.
- Clickjacking and issues only exploitable through clickjacking.
- Logout Cross-Site Request Forgery (logout CSRF).
- Content Spoofing.
- Presence of application or web browser ‘autocomplete’ or ‘save password’ functionality.
- Lack of Secure/HTTPOnly flags on non-sensitive Cookies.
- Lack of "security speed bump" when leaving the site.
- Weak Captcha / Captcha bypass.
- Login or Forgot Password page brute force and account lockout not enforced.
- Username / email enumeration.

- Email bombing
- Request Flooding
- Lack of rate limiting
- CSV Injection
- Issues where paid or premium features are accessible on free accounts with no inherent "security" implications (impacts to the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability of the product) may be considered Informational and rewarded points.

## Rules

- You must ensure that customer data is not affected in any way as a result of your testing. Please ensure you're being non-destructive whilst testing and are only testing using accounts and instances created via the instructions under “Creating your instance” above.
- In addition to above, customer instances are not to be accessed in any way (i.e. no customer data is accessed, customer credentials are not to be used or "verified")
	- If you believe you have found sensitive customer data (e.g., login credentials, API keys etc) or a way to access customer data (i.e. through a vulnerability) report it, but **do not attempt to validate or authenticate with these credentials.**
- If you come across Atlassian Employee login credentials, API keys, or similar sensitive information, please report it immediately. **However, please do not attempt to verify or authenticate with these credentials.**
- *Use of any automated tools/scanners is strictly prohibited* and will lead to you being removed from the program (trust us, we have those tools too).
- Reports need to be submitted in plain text (associated pictures/videos are fine as long as they're in standard formats). Non-plain text reports (e.g. PDF, DOCX) will be asked to be resubmitted in plain text.
- To facilitate timely report acceptance, please utilize the **Reporting Guidelines** below.
- Sufficiently similar access control issues should be grouped in one report. Atlassian defines “sufficiently similar” as issues that use the same permissions/configuration for bypassing a particular control, which may be used on multiple related vulnerable endpoints or actions (User X with Y permissions can Create/Delete/Edit Resource Z).
- Grants/awards are at the discretion of Atlassian and we withhold the right to grant, modify or deny grants. But we'll be fair about it.
- Tax implications of any payouts are the sole responsibility of the reporter.
- Do NOT conduct non-technical attacks such as social engineering or phishing attacks on Atlassian, its staff, or customers. Reports that rely on theoretical social engineering or phishing for a successful attack may be considered albeit with a much lesser severity impact.
- Do NOT test the physical security of Atlassian offices, employees, equipment, etc.
- This bounty follows Bugcrowd’s standard disclosure terms.
- Any vulnerability found in a JIRA or Confluence Data Center product may not be eligible for a reward in Jira/Confluence Cloud, and vice versa (i.e. no double dipping).

### Scoring and Exceptions

Atlassian uses [CVSS](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/security-severity-levels) to consistently score security vulnerabilities. There may be internal mitigations or controls that affect the final CVSS score and thus final assessed severity. Where discrepancies between the VRT and CVSS score exist, Atlassian will defer to the CVSS score to determine the priority.  
A few issue types are not scored by their CVSS scores. These are typically higher severity, but will be rewarded as P4 issues:

- XSS Vulnerabilities where the script is blocked by the product's Content Security Policy, unless a bypass is documented as part of the submission
- XSS Vulnerabilities where the session cookie has HTTPOnly and Secure Flag set, unless extraction of the session cookie is documented as part of the submission
- Open Redirect bugs, and
- Broken Access Control or Privilege Escalation bugs, where an Administrator is able to perform System Administrator actions.

These are typically CVSS High (P2) but will be rewarded as Medium (P3) issues:

- XSS in Data Center products

### Reporting Credentials

If you believe you have found Atlassian employee or customer credentials please report them but do **not** attempt to validate them.  
Credential Reports will be handled as follows:

- Customer credential reports will be marked as P5 (Informational)
- Atlassian employee credentials will have severity adjusted based on CVSS, but will only be paid out if they can access Atlassian resources (i.e. credentials not related to their work at Atlassian will receive points but will not be paid out)

### Reporting Guidelines

A well-crafted report enables effective communication of the issue to our product teams. It also simplifies the process of replicating and validating the submission. A submission that is clear and comprehensively documented aids in triage, validation, and leads to expedited report acceptance.  
Where applicable, the following information should be included:

- Brief summary of the submission (including product versions tested for Data Center products)
- Prerequisites or initial conditions (including any products, user privileges, tools required, files prepared, web server configurations, or any other initial conditions which need to be set prior to initiating the proof of concept)
- Reproduction steps (including any vulnerable endpoints, parameters, payloads used, source code for scripts, or command line inputs)
	- Inclusion of burp requests (or HTTP request examples), screenshots, and screen recordings are highly encouraged.
		- Templates and/or scripts for testing, such as a nuclei template or python script, are desirable for a submission.
- Expected results / behaviour vs actual results / behaviour. Please include any links to formal documentation or resources which state the expected behaviour.
- Assessed security impact (as it relates to the Confidentiality, Integrity, and/or Availability of the product)

Where possible, the following information is could be additionally included:

- Possible mitigations, fixes and security controls (The more product specific the better).
- Root cause analysis of the vulnerability.
- Business impact.
- For Data Center and on-premise products, a list of impacted versions beyond current version.
- References.

### Public Disclosure

At Atlassian, one of our values is Open Company, No Bullshit, we believe that vulnerability disclosure is a part of that value. We hold ourselves to the security bug fix service level objectives, found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy), and will accept disclosure requests in the bug bounty program after the issue has been fixed and released in production. However, if the report contains any information regarding a customer instance or data the request will be rejected. If you are planning to disclose outside of the bug bounty, we ask that you give us reasonable notice and wait until the [associated SLO](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy) has passed.
