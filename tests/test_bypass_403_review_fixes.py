"""Regression checks for the 403/401 bypass probe's confidence model.

PR #40 replaced the earlier token-normalizing body comparison
(`_normalize_body` + `[CONFIRMED]/[POSSIBLE]/[INFORMATIONAL]` tiers) with a
broader WAF-aware verdict pipeline: sample a block baseline, reject responses
that match a WAF block signature, require the body length to diverge from the
baseline, and split results into confirmed (`bypass_hits.txt`) vs needs-review
(`bypass_uncertain.txt`). These tests guard that newer mechanism so a future
rewrite can't silently drop the "is this a real bypass or still a block page?"
check that keeps false positives out of findings.
